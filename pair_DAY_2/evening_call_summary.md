# Evening Call Summary Day 2

Written by Amare Kassa | Confirmed by Kidus

On Kidus’s explainer, the initial draft already identified the key architectural distinction between runtime-enforced scaffolding and model-invoked tool usage. However, I pushed on whether apparent “tool grounding failures” always come from the model itself, or whether some failures originate earlier in the runtime and orchestration layer.

During the discussion, I asked for a clearer distinction between:
- the model ignoring tool/context information
vs
- the runtime never routing structured context into generation at all.

I also requested that the explanation connect more directly to the reviewed Week 10 `conversion-engine` implementation instead of remaining at a generalized “agent systems” level.

In response, the explainer was revised to:
- directly reference `process_prospect()` and the enrichment pipeline
- explain that `check_bench_availability()` executes before generation begins
- clarify that the runtime, not the model, owns execution authority in the reviewed architecture
- distinguish deterministic runtime enforcement from probabilistic model reasoning

The discussion became more concrete after I traced my own objection-response implementation and discovered that `reply_type="objection"` had no dedicated handling path. This caused structured context to fall through to a generic fallback response before the model could reason over the probe information.

That debugging step clarified an important insight:

> some apparent “LLM grounding failures” are actually runtime routing failures.

The discussion also clarified why advisory prompt labels are weaker than explicit reasoning tokens. The revised explanation showed that constraints become more reliable when represented as part of the token-generation trajectory itself (via `Constraint check:`) rather than passive metadata.

After revision, the explainer became much more grounded in both:
- the reviewed Week 10 implementation
- and my own follow-up debugging work

and directly answered the original question about reliability differences between runtime scaffolding and model-invoked tools.
